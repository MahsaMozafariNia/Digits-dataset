# Digits-dataset
In this project, I am going to fit some classifiers on digit dataset to predict the images.
Classifiers which I am going to use are SVM (linear- non linear)/ Decision Tree/ Forest/ Bagging (base estimator=tree)/ Boosting (base estimator=tree)/ Convolutional neural network.
I am going to find best model with best parameters.
Some of the codes takes lots of time to run. Please be patient.
